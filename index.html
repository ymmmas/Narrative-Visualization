        <h3>This visualization shows how different brands strategically use varying engine cylinder counts  to meet specific market demands and brand identities.
            
        </h3>
        <p> <b>Electric vehicle brands</b>, which use no engine cylinders, are at the forefront of the market in promoting sustainability and reducing carbon emissions through their electric vehicle offerings.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Economical brands</b> focus on fuel efficiency and affordability. Their preference for 4-8 cylinder engines reflects their goal of offering vehicles with high MPG that are both affordable and efficient.
        </p>
        <p>Some <b>luxury brands</b> offer a wide range of models to meet the needs of both efficiency-focused and performance-seeking consumers. While some brands focus on high-performance engines with more cylinders for greater power and speed. They all have the capability to offer higher cylinder counts when necessary.</p>
